# :new: SWAN

This branch contains the new generation of the SWAN framework. **It is still WIP and not ready for use. â€‹**:construction:

###  Summary

We have completely redesigned SWAN. It now parses plain-text that can either be dumped with `xcodebuild` or `swiftc`. Previously, we hooked into the Swift compiler which created many build problems and added complexity. We've developed a new IR, called *SWIRL*, that is simple, well documented, and easy to understand. Any analysis engine should be able to analyze SWIRL without having to handle complex semantics. We are currently working on integrating SWIRL into [SPDS](https://github.com/CodeShield-Security/SPDS).
